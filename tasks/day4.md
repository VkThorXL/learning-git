# Day 4 – Branching, Merging & Handling Merge Conflicts

## What I Practiced Today

### 1. Creating Branches
- How to create new branches with `git branch branch-name`
- How to switch branches using `git checkout branch-name`  
- How to create + switch in one command using `git checkout -b branch-name`

### 2. Merging Branches
- Merging without conflicts using `git merge branch-name`
- Fast-forward vs non-fast-forward merges

### 3. Handling Merge Conflicts
- Simulating conflicts manually
- Using nano to resolve conflicts inside files
- Running `git add` and `git commit` after resolving

### 4. Practical Muscle-Memory Commands
- `git branch`
- `git checkout -b feature/update-readme`
- `git merge main`
- Editing conflict markers:
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  =======
  >>>>>>> branch-name

## What I Did in the Repo (Hands-On)

- Created a feature branch
- Updated README on a separate branch
- Merged branch back into main
- Resolved a simulated merge conflict successfully

## Recruiter-Friendly Summary

Today’s work demonstrates:
- Ability to work with Git branches professionally
- Knowledge of merging workflows used in real teams
- Confidence in resolving merge conflicts (a strong hiring signal)
